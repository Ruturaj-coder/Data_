Dear Team EDPML,

As I wrap up my journey here today, I just wanted to say a heartfelt thank you to each one of you. Working with this team has been one of the most memorable and enriching experiences of my life.

From those fun tea breaks in the breakout area to the incredible support and warmth I received every day â€” everything has meant so much to me. More than just technical skills, Iâ€™ve grown as a person, and thatâ€™s all thanks to you.

I genuinely hope I get the chance to join this wonderful team again next year â€” it would truly be a dream come true. ðŸ˜Š

Until then, take care and keep in touch!

Warm regards,
Ruturaj Amrutkar
